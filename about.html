            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Founded in 1975, <strong>Lux</strong> started from humble beginnings as a small garage sale venture. With a passion for quality and an eye for customer preferences, our founders began to notice the growing demand for well-crafted, functional furniture. What started as a simple operation evolved into a business dedicated to fulfilling the unique needs of customers, one piece of furniture at a time. Slowly, through hard work and a commitment to craftsmanship, Lux transitioned from a local business to a well-recognized brand in the furniture industry.</p>

                <p>As the company grew, so did its mission. Lux became more than just a furniture provider; it became a brand that stood for quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction. We learned early on that furniture was not just about function, but about creating spaces that reflected the individuality and lifestyle of our customers. Every product we designed carried with it our promise of durability, style, and comfort, ensuring that we met the expectations of homeowners and businesses alike.</p>

                <p>Today, Lux continues to lead the way in the furniture industry by staying true to its roots while embracing modern trends and technologies. Our commitment to quality and customer service remains as strong as ever, and we continue to innovate, pushing the boundaries of design and functionality. From humble garage sales to a thriving business, Lux’s journey is a testament to the power of vision, hard work, and a deep understanding of what truly matters to our customers: beautiful, reliable furniture that transforms their spaces.</p>
